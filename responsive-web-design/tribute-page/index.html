        <h2>First wave</h2>
        <p>
          The first wave of black metal refers to bands during the 1980s who
          influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre.
          By today's musical standards, their sound is closer to speed metal or
          thrash metal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their
          second album Black Metal (1982). Although generally deemed speed metal
          or thrash metal rather than black metal, the album's lyrics and
          imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any
          before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with
          raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a
          practice that became widespread among black metal musicians.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other major influences in black metal include Bathory from Sweden,
          Hellhammer from Switzerland and Merciful Fate from Denmark

        <h2>Second Wave</h2>
        <p>
          The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was
          spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During 1990–1993, a
          number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind
          of black metal music; this included Mayhem, Darkthrone, Burzum,
          Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon, Enslaved, Thorns, and Gorgoroth.
        </p>
        <p>
          They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct
          genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing
          developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch and Øystein 'Euronymous'
          Aarseth. Fenriz of Darkthrone described it as being "derived from
          Bathory" and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for
          a lot of bands in the '90s"
