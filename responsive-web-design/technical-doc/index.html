            Some topic are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in
            some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not
            have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
            follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
            control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from
            LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>

          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!

          <p>The Acinteyya - four imponderables</p>
          <p>What are the 4 imponderables?</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The Buddha-range of the Buddhas [i.e., the range of powers a
              Buddha develops as a result of becoming a Buddha]
            </li>
            <li>
              The jhana-range of one absorbed in jhana [i.e., the range of
              powers that one may obtain while absorbed in jhana]
            </li>
            <li>
              The [precise working out of the] results of kamma (Karma in
              Sanskrit)
            </li>
            <li>
              Speculation about [the origin, etc., of] the cosmos is an
              imponderable that is not to be speculated about (SN 56.41 develops
              this speculation as the ten indeterminate)
